# Discord.Net CODE SAMPLES

This thing is just some samples used in MilošBot, discord bot which I started with about half a year ago. For me personally were samples the best thing how to make new things, so I hope for you too.

There will be more in the future (at least I hope for it xd)

Please don´t use this if you don´t know basics of the language or coding.
Everything was done via C# and Discord.Net library and maybe some others for API
Huge thanks to AoshiW who helped me a lot with learning this stuff.

That's all, I hope it helped :)
